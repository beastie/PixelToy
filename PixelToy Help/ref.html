These sections will help you understand the variousPixelToy control windows as well.  If you haven't yet read the<a href="PixelToy%20Help.html">PixelToy Manual</a>, it is recommended that youunderstand the concepts explained there before consulting this reference.<a name="file">&nbsp;</a><hr><font size="+2"><b>File Menu</b></font> <br><font size="-1"> <a href="#f0">Open Sets...</a> | <a href="#f1">Open Picture...</a> | <a href="#f2">Reload last Picture</a> | <a href="#f3">Save PNG...</a> | <a href="#f4">Save Current Sets As...</a> | <ahref="#f5">Create Movie...</a> | <a href="#f6">Clear Screen</a> | <a href="#f7">Pause</a> | <a href="#f8">Close Window</a> </font> <a name="f0">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Open Sets...</b></font> <br>Open a Sets file.  When launched normally, PixelToy automatically uses the"PixelToy Sets" file stored in the same folder as your applicationpreferences. With this command, you can open a different group of Sets to use. You can achieve the same effectby opening a particular Sets file in the Finder, or by drag-and-dropping itonto PixelToy's icon. <br><a name="f1">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Open Picture...</b></font> <br>Open a picture to be distorted and drawn upon. All common image formats are supported (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.). Images are treated as grayscalewhen opened, and color information is ignored because PixelToy generates its own color. Normally, PixelToy will resize the window to match the image's dimensions, however you can disable this in the <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> dialog. <b>Note:</b> This command loads your picture once, with the Filters acting upon the resulting image over time to remove it. If you want your picture to remain in the display, use the <a href="#a9">Images</a> action instead. <br><a name="f2">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Reload last Picture</b></font> <br>Wow, PixelToy sure destroyed that picture quickly! Reload it again automatically with this command. PixelToy will not resize the window to fit the image; if you want it to, reopen the image with <a href="#f1">Open Picture</a>. <br><a name="f3">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Save PNG...</b></font> <br>Save the window's current contents as a PNG image. <br><a name="f4">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Save Current Sets As...</b></font> <br>Save all sets shown in the Sets menu into a new Sets file. After doing this, any further changes to the Sets will be saved to this file. See <a href="PixelToy%20Help.html#sets"><i>About sets</i></a> for more general information. <br><a name="f5">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/qtoutput.gif" width="166" height="118" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Create Movie...</b></font> <br>Start saving a QuickTime Movie. First, you'll be asked if you want a <b>Fixed Frame Rate</b> or <b>Real Time</b>. A fixed frame rate lets you specify exactly how fast you would like the movie to play back after you have created it, regardless of how quickly or slowly the movie is created. You specify this <i>Frames Per Second</i> number in the QuickTime window you get after selecting a file name for your movie. If you choose Real Time, the <i>Frames Per Second</i> value in the QuickTime window is ignored, and instead the resulting movie will play back at precisely the same speed at which it was recorded, allowing you to later synchronize it with audio, for example. In the QuickTime window you'll also be asked what compression method to use -- if your movie is intended to play back smoothly, you'll want either the <i>Video</i> or <i>Cinepak</i> compressor. If you're generating footage that will be used in a video editor such as iMovie or Adobe After Effects, you'll want <i>Photo - JPEG</i> with quality nearly maximum. If you're recording in Real Time, the <i>Video</i> compressor (maximum quality, no keyframes) is a good choice as it compresses very quickly. After starting to create a movie, you can hold down command-period or select this same menu command (which will be called "Stop Movie") to end movie creation. <b>Tips:</b> Use the <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> window to set the size of PixelToy's window numerically. You can do <i>anything</i> in PixelToy while generating a movie <i>except</i> resize the PixelToy window. <br><br>When you are finished creating the movie, select this menu command again,which will be instead named "Stop Movie".  Movies created in this manner are ready for use in many video editor programs.To use QuickTime movies such as this within iMovie, you'll need <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/buy">QuickTime 7 Pro</a> (the $30 full featured edition).  Open your PixelToyQuickTime movie in "QuickTime Player 7" application (found Applications/Utilities/) and select "Export..."  from the File menu.  On the next window change the "Export:" pop-up menu to "Movie to DV Stream".  It may take a while to save, and you'll end up with a rather large DV file that you can import into iMovie and treat like just any other video clip.<br><a name="f6">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Clear Screen</b></font> <br>Wipes the PixelToy window clean. <br><a name="f7">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Pause</b></font> <br>Halts animation. Select this command again to start the animation again. This command is particularly handy when creating a movie; set all of your options, pause, clear screen, then begin creating the movie. Nothing will be written to the movie until you un-pause the animation. <br><a name="f8">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Close Window</b></font> <br>As you might expect, except that if you close the main PixelToy window, the program will completely quit. <br><a name="options">&nbsp;</a><hr><img src="img/winoptions.gif" width="112" height="207" align="right"> <font size="+2"><b>Options Menu &amp; Window</b></font> <br><br><font size="-1"> <a href="#o1">Autopilot</a> | <a href="#o2">Pixel Doubling</a> | <a href="#o3">High-Quality</a> | <a href="#o4">Full Screen</a> | <a href="#o5">Dither Updates</a> | <a href="#o6">Configure Autopilot</a> | <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> | <a href="#o8">Apply Filters Last</a> | <a href="#o9">Image Emboss</a> | <a href="#o10">Sound Visual Options</a> | <a href="#o11">Text Options</a> | <a href="#o12">Particle Options</a> | <a href="#o13">Image Options</a> | <a href="#o14">Misc Options</a> <br></font> <br>The Options control window is identical to the pull-down menu; "checked" items are shown brighter than normal items. <i>The first section of theOptions menu and control window consists of global settings which persist even when loading sets.</i><br> <a name="o1">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Autopilot</b></font> <br>With the Autopilot enabled, PixelToy will periodically change actions, action options, filters, mirroring, and/or color palettes.

While in Full Screen mode, you can make the menu bar appear by clicking up where it should be; it will become visible. The first time you activate Full Screen mode, you will be asked if you would like your main display switched to low resolution whenever you enter Full Screen mode in the future; you may later change your mind in the <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> window. If you quit while in Full Screen mode, PixelToy will remember to reactivate it automatically the next time it is launched. On multiple monitor systems, first drag the main PixelToy window entirely onto the monitor you wish to use before invoking this command. Going to full screen mode hides the other windows -- if you would like them back while still in full screen mode, use the <a href="#w1">Show All</a> command in the Windows menu. <br><a name="o5">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Dither Updates</b></font> <br>Only has an effect when the display is configured to display only Thousands of colors, this option will mix colors when drawing to avoid the bands of solid color that tend to appear in Thousands of colors otherwise.<br><a name="o6">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/winautopilot.gif" width="144" height="165" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Configure Autopilot</b></font> <br>This window allows you to fine-tune PixelToy's <a href="#o1">AutoPilot</a> command. You may specify the number of seconds between changes, and select what the AutoPilot is allowed to randomly modify: <br><br><b>Turn these actions on and off</b>: Any actions highlighted here may be turned entirely on or off by the AutoPilot. The AutoPilot will not allow more than 3 actions to be on at the same time. <br><b>Change options for these actions</b>: With this selected, the AutoPilot may change options (such as size) for any actions which are both highlighted here and <i>and</i> currently being displayed in PixelToy's main window. <br><b>Allow sound reaction</b>: Allows the AutoPilot to turn on the Sound Visuals action or activate sound-reaction options on other actions. <br><b>Always react to sound</b>: Forces the AutoPilot to use sound-reaction options on all actions. <br><b>Filters</b> and <b>Mirrors</b>: Simply allows filters and mirrors to be turned on and off. The AutoPilot will only use one filter at a time. <br><b>Use random color palette</b>: Lets the AutoPilot do the equivalent of selecting <a href="#c1">Random</a> from the Colors window. <br><b>Use saved color palette</b>: Allows the random selection of any named color palette listed in the Colors window. <br><br clear="RIGHT"><a name="o7">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/winprefs1.gif" width="196" height="226" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Preferences</b></font> <br>This tabbed dialog lets you control many global settings of PixelToy. <br><br><b>Change Display for Full Screen:</b> When selected, the two pop-up menus allow you to select any resolution and color depth supported by your video system. Note that resolutions not supported by your monitor may appear in this list! For those with multiple monitor systems, the resolutions shown are for the monitor on which the PixelToy animation window is currently displayed (i.e. the monitor which will be used for full screen mode). <br><b>Speed Limit</b> will restrain the animation speed to the number of frames-per-second that you type here. <br><b>Window Size</b> allows you to set exact dimensions for the PixelToy window, useful when creating movies. <br><b>Frames for palette transition</b> defines how many frames of animation are used to change color palettes. Has no effect when displaying less than Thousands of colors. <br><b>Don't Let Images Resize Window</b> keeps the <a href="#f1">Open Picture</a> command from resizing the PixelToy window to the size of the image being opened. <br><b>Don't Show Splash-Screen</b> keeps the About PixelToy window from appearing when you start PixelToy. <br><b>Use First Set of Opened Sets</b> enables PixelToy to automatically use the first set in a Sets file when the file is double-clicked or drag-and-dropped on PixelToy. <br><b>Show Set Comments</b> allows a set to display its comments when it is used. <br><b>Allow Rough Random Colors</b> permits the <a href="#c1">Random Palette</a> command to create more rough-edged palettes. <br><b>Keep Mouse Hidden</b> hides the mouse cursor when it is over the PixelToy window. <br><b>Note Missing Fonts</b> allows PixelToy to notify you when you load a set that uses fonts not installed on your computer. <br><b>Show Frames Per Second</b> activates a number display on the title bar ofthe PixelToy window, displaying how many frames of animation PixelToy has been able to generate in the last second. <br><br clear="right"><img src="img/winprefs2.gif" width="196" height="226" align="right"> The <b>Audio Device</b> pop-up menu allows you to select an audio input device for PixelToy to react to. If you don't see "Built-in" choices available,you may need a USB microphone in order for PixelToy to react to audio. An audio device may potentially have several different <b>Audio Sources</b> to choose from, though most devices seem to just have one. <br><b>Play Audio Input through Output</b> allows you to hear this audio input from your Mac's sound system. Note that this feature is not available with most audio devices. <br><b>Auto Device Hardware Gain</b> settings, if supported by your device, may automaticallyimprove PixelToy's reaction to loud or quiet audio sources. <br><b>Hardware Gain</b> allows you to manually adjust the volume of your audio input source to a suitable level. Once again, setting hardware gain may not be supported by your device. If you adjust this value <b>and</b> use Auto device Hardware Gain, there's no telling what your device will do. <br><b>Software Gain</b> does not depend on device capabilities, and can always be used to amplify PixelToy's reaction without affecting the audio level when played through output. <br clear="right"><br><a name="o8">&nbsp;</a><hr><i>The second section of the Options menu and control window consists oflocal settings that are stored in sets.</i> <br><font size="+1"><b>Apply Filters Last</b></font> <br>Apply Filters Last makes PixelToy apply the <a href="PixelToy%20Help.html#filters">Filters</a> after the <a href="PixelToy%20Help.html#actions">Actions</a>, instead of the normal behavior of applying the Filters before the Actions. This is particularly useful when using the Kaleidoscope filter. <br><a name="o9">&nbsp;</a> <br><font size="+1"><b>Image Emboss</b></font> <br>This option applies a graphic filter that makes the normal display appear as protrusions and indentations in a surface. Embossing usually looks best with a continuously shaded color palette such as Greyscale; if you generate a random color palette while Image Emboss is enabled, the created palette will be continuously shaded. <br><a name="o10">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/soundvisuals.gif" width="254" height="174" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Sound Visual Options</b></font> <br>Up to 16 different sound visual objects can be created and edited here. Four types of objects may be used (see below), along with the ability to size, move, flip, rotate, and otherwise customize your display. <br><br><i>List order:</i> Sound Visual objects are drawn from the top of the list down; therefore, if you have overlapping objects, the lower item in the list will appear on top of a higher item. You can use the <b>To Back</b> and <b>To Front</b> buttons to shuffle your objects around. <br><br><i>Type:</i> Four fundamental object types exist as shown below. The "Sound Wave" is the default object, resembling an oscilloscope display. The other three types all use frequency amplitudes to create a "graph" of current sound frequencies as either a bar display, brick-like blocks, or a line display.<table border="1" cellpadding="2" align="right"><tr><td><img src="img/svtype1.gif" width="154" height="112"></td><td><img src="img/svtype2.gif" width="154" height="112"></td></tr><tr><td><center>Sound Wave</center></td><td><center>Frequency Bar</center></td></tr><tr><td><img src="img/svtype3.gif" width="154" height="112"></td><td><img src="img/svtype4.gif" width="154" height="112"></td></tr><tr><td><center>Frequency Brick</center></td><td><center>Frequency Line</center></td></tr></table><br><br><i>Action:</i> <b>Stationary</b> stays where you put it. <b>Vertical Slide</b> slowly bounces from the top of the display to the bottom and back again. <b>Horizonal Slide</b> does the same but left to right. <b>Wandering</b> makes the object bumble around with a mind of its own. <b>Random Jump</b>ing objects appear at a different place constantly. Finally, <b>Mouse</b> make the object appear where the mouse cursor is, usually with the 'Keep Mouse Hidden' option in the <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> window. <br><br><i>Solid</i> objects are entire regions instead of mere lines. The Thickness option is ignored when an object is solid. <br><br><i>Rotate 90 degrees</i>: Tip an object on its side for a vertical sound wave or horizontal bars. <br><br><i>Flip Horizontal</i> and <i>Flip Vertical</i> does as you might imagine, though for a Sound Wave the effect is not particularly noticeable unless it is also solid. <br><br><i>Brightness</i> dictates what color from the palette in which the object is drawn.<br><br><i>Thickness</i> simply controls how thick the lines are drawn. This option is ignored when an object is solid. <br><br><i>Spacing</i> indicates the distance between individual Frequency Bars and Bricks, and is ignored for Sound Waves and Frequency Lines. <br clear="RIGHT"><a name="o11">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/textoptions.gif" width="272" height="180" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Text Options</b></font> <br>You can edit all aspects of text in PixelToy within this window. Create up to 16 different text objects, each with its own font, action, brightness, and size. <br><br><i>List order:</i> Text is drawn from the top of the list down; therefore, if you have overlapping text objects, the lower item in the list will appear on top of a higher item. You can use the <b>To Back</b> and <b>To Front</b> buttons to shuffle your text objects around to your liking. <br><br><i>Actions:</i> <b>Stationary</b> merely stays where you put it. <b>Jitter</b> causes the text to vibrate like it's fulla caffeine. <b>Bouncing (Zero G)</b> makes the text bounce off the four walls like a ball in Pong. <b>Bouncing (Gravity)</b> will make the text bounce like a ball trapped in a box, until it slows down, at which point it is given a kick to get moving again. <b>Wandering</b> text objects bumble around at random. <b>Mouse</b> simply makes the text appear where the mouse cursor is. This one is best accompanied by activating the 'Keep Mouse Hidden' option in the <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> window. Finally, <b>Vibrate</b> is a bit calmer version of Jitter. <br><br><i>Outline:</i> Select this item to draw an outline around this text object to improve its readability. This option can considerably slow down the animation.<br><br><i>Brightness:</i> <b>Fixed</b> allows you to specify a brightness level with the slider control. <b>Pulsing</b> makes the text brightness go from 0% to 100% and back to 0% continuously. <b>Based on Sound</b> makes the brightness of the text depend on the sound volume of the currently selected sound input device. <br><br><i>Size:</i> Text size is expressed as a percentage of the window height; values anywhere from 0% to 400% are allowed. <b>Based on Sound</b> makes the text size change based on the sound volume of the currently selected sound input device, with maximum volume resulting in the percentage sizespecified.<br><a name="o12">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/particleoptions.gif" width="307" height="177" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Particle Options</b></font> <br>All particle controls are located on this window. You can have up to 16 different particle generators defined, listed on the left. <br><br><i>Name:</i> This is for your organization only; the name isn't displayed anywhere else in PixelToy. <br><br><i>Particle Type:</i> <b>Water</b> is the default type. <b>Bugs</b> bumble around, and if solid, will periodically land on bright objects. <b>Snow</b> falls from the top of the screen and (once again, if solid) will collect on bright surfaces. <b>Repulsion</b> particles avoid bright objects and each other. <br><br><i>Action:</i> <b>Stationary</b> generators stay still. <b>Follow Mouse</b> aims the generator in the general direction of the mouse cursor. You may want to activate the 'Keep Mouse Hidden' option in the <a href="#o7"> Preferences</a> window along with this. <b>Random</b> makes the generator randomly point in different directions. <b>React To Sound</b> makes the Flow Rate and speed of the generator based on the sound volume of the currently selected sound input device. <br><br><i>Other Controls:</i> <b>Flow Rate</b> adjusts the amount of particles which come out of the generator. <b>Gravity</b> controls the force pulling the particles to the bottom of the window. <b>Particle Size</b> controls the size of the individual particles; to ensure that the particles look the same with and without <a href="#o2">Pixel Doubling</a> enabled, set the size to at least 10%. <b>Spout Width</b> and <b>Spout Height</b> control the size of the area from which the particles are emitted. <b>Spray</b> controls how much particles can randomly vary from the direction and speed you have defined in the preview window. <b>Brightness</b> determines thecolor in which these particles are drawn.  <b>Bounce off walls &amp; ceiling</b> allows you to only let the particles out through the bottom of the window. <b>Solid</b> particles are affected by other objects (including each other). Be careful; if your flow is high and your spout is small, solid particles will bunch up and 'clog up' the particle generator. Repulsion particles are always solid. The <b>Blend All</b> button replaces thesettings of all of your generators except the first and last one, changingthem to blended steps.  It is helpful to experiment with this last button inorder to fully understand it.<br><a name="o13">&nbsp;</a> <br><img src="img/imageoptions.gif" width="268" height="175" align="right"> <font size="+1"><b>Image Options</b></font> <br>Everything controlling the display of image objects is accessed in this window. You can have up to 16 image objects defined. Clicking in the preview window lets you select, move, and resize your image objects. <br><br><img src="img/imagebit.gif" width="55" height="152" align="left"> You can use your images in two different modes, <i>1-Bit</i> or <i>8-Bit:</i> <b>1-Bit</b> images are 'flat' and only display two colors. When 1-Bit images are transparent, only the light color is drawn, leaving other areas untouched. You can control the 'brightness' of 1-Bit images by defining it as <i>Fixed</i> where you select a value with the slider control, <i>Pulsing</i> constantly changes from 0% to 100% back to 0% brightness, and <i>Based on Sound</i> will set the brightness based on the volume of the current sound input. <b>8-Bit</b> images can use the entire PixelToy color palette of 256 colors, but their brightness is unchangeable. To make an 8-Bit image transparent, you must select another image file to use as a 1-Bit <i>mask</i> file. <br><br>When you add a new image with the <b>Add</b> button, PixelToy will attempt to use an image file named "Default Image" and mask file named "Default Mask" in the same folder as the PixelToy application.

You can activate a filter by itself by pressing the letter key associated with its name in the pull-down menu; all other filters are then turned off automatically. If you want to <b>add</b> a filter via the keyboard, hold down the shift key when typing the letter. <b>Mirror</b> settings can likewise be toggled bypressing the number key associated with their names in the menu. <br><br><b>Filter window:</b> Active filters are shown in red. Clicking on a filter icon activates that filter by itself. To <b>add</b> a filter, shift click on its icon. Holding down the option key when clicking on the 'custom' filter icon brings up the <b>Edit Custom Filter</b> dialog window. <b>Mirror buttons</b> control image mirroring. <br><br><b>Mirroring:</b> Vertical Mirror divides the PixelToy display into two halves, with the right half being a reflection of the left half. Horizontal Mirror unsurprisingly does the same thing for top and bottom halves. Both may be active at the same time for a nice effect. The <b>Constrain</b> mirror option forces all filters and actions to not act directly upon the reflections, and therefore only has an effect if a mirror is active. <br><br clear="RIGHT"><table border="0" align="center">        <tr>	<td align="right" width="110"> <i>Without <br>	Constrain</i> </td> <td> <img src="img/mirror1.jpg" width="96" height="82"> 	<br>		<center>	(No Mirror)	</center>		</td> <td valign="top"> <img src="img/mirror2.jpg" width="96" height="82"> 	</td> <td valign="top"> <img src="img/mirror3.jpg" width="96" height="82"> 	</td> <td valign="top"> <img src="img/mirror4.jpg" width="96" height="82"> 	</td>    </tr>    </table><table border="0" align="center">        <tr>	<td align="right" width="110"> <i>With <br>	Constrain</i> </td> <td width="96"> </td> <td> <img src="img/mirror5.jpg" 	width="96" height="82"> </td> <td> <img src="img/mirror6.jpg" width="96" 	height="82"> </td> <td> <img src="img/mirror7.jpg" width="96" height="82"> 	</td>    </tr>    </table><br><br><img src="img/customfilter.gif" width="150" height="159" align="left"> <font size="+1"><b>Edit Custom Filter</b></font> <br>All of the preset filters are fast because they are optimized specifically for what they do. If none of the presets do what you want, you may be able to achieve the desired effect via the <b>Custom Filter</b>. Every pixel that is filtered through the custom filter uses this table of numbers to determine the filter behavior. The center cell represents the pixel you are generating, all others represent neighboring pixels. A number represents the weight, or importance of a pixel. In this example, the original pixel is worth 40, the pixel directly below is worth 32, and so on. All of the pixel values are added up based on these weights, and divided based on the <b>target</b> value. Normally you want your total and target equal (100%), but interesting effects can be generated by setting a lower or higher target. Numbers used here are arbitrary and are only important in their values relative to one another. The percentage shown next to the total is the only absolute number used in this dialog. You can load and save custom filter settings -- the quickest way to learn how the custom filter works is to load some of the included filters and observe the resulting effect. Any changes you make to these numbers have no immediate effect until you either click the Apply button or the OK button. <i>Note that because of its user-defined nature, the Custom Filter is not optimized and can be several times slower than the preset filters.</i> <br><br clear="RIGHT"><a name="colors">&nbsp;</a><hr><img src="img/wincolors.jpg" width="112" height="219" align="right"> <font size="+2"><b>Colors Menu &amp; Window</b></font> <br><font size="-1"> <a href="#c1">Random</a> | <a href="#c2">Add this Palette...</a> | <a href="#c3">Delete a Palette...</a> | <a href="#c4">Previous</a> | <a href="#c5">Next</a> | <a href="#c6"><i>Palette Animation</i></a></font> <br><i><a href="PixelToy%20Help.html#colors">About Color Palettes</a></i> <br><br>Clicking on a color palette in the Colors window uses that palette. Adjusting the 'Frames for palette transition' number in the <a href="#o7">Preferences</a> dialog allows you to control the speed at which the new palette takes effect.
