[PixelToy](http://www.lairware.com/pixeltoy) started as a play project to explore live image filtering and general graphic silliness, and slowly grew over time as the world shifted from 68K processors to PowerPC to Intel, and from the cooperative multitasking world of classic Mac OS to modern unix-based macOS.  PixelToy hasn't been under anything resembling active development for an extremely long time, and the demise of 32-bit (and with it Carbon) in macOS Catalina has put a firm underscore on that status for me.

PixelToy actually does build and run under (a modified) Xcode 9.4.1 on macOS 10.14.  "Modified" in that it contains the 10.6 SDK and other tweaks necessary to allow and support that.  I intend to either add a link to someone else describing this process or maybe I'll even document it myself later.
