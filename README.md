# PixelToy
PixelToy started as a play project to explore live image filtering and general graphic silliness, and slowly grew over time as the world shifted from 68K processors to PowerPC to Intel, and from the cooperative multitasking world of classic Mac OS to modern unix-based macOS.  PixelToy hasn't been under anything resembling active development for an extremely long time, and the demise of 32-bit (and with it Carbon) in macOS Catalina has put a firm underscore on that status for me.
